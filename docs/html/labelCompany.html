      <section>
          <h2>2008–2010: Establishment and mainstream breakthrough</h2>
          <p>Happy Face Entertainment was established on August 15, 2008, as Harvest Entertainment (풍년 엔터테인먼트) by Lee Joo Won. The label changed their name to Happy Face Entertainment (해피페이스 엔터테인먼트) on January 23, 2009.</p>
          <p>The agency debuted their first artist, Nassun, through Lee Hyo-ri's 2008 hit U-Go-Girl, which was produced by E-Tribe. This single launched E-Tribe, Nassun, and the agency into mainstream popularity.</p>
          <p>On January 5, 2009, Girls' Generation released the single Gee, which was produced by E-Tribe. The single charted at number one on South Korea's Gaon Chart for two months and claimed over ten year-end awards. A Japanese version of the song was released in 2010 with composition credited to E-Tribe.</p>
          <p>Rap-pop duo One Two (previously established in 2003), signed a contract with Happy Face Entertainment in early 2009. The duo released "Starry Night", "Bad Girl (ft. Seo In-young), "Walala Lalale", and "Very Good" before their disbandment in late 2010.</p>

          <h2>2011–2015: Debuting artist, joint venture and development</h2>
          <p>Following the success of E-Tribe's productions, the label made the decision to debut their first idol girl group, Dal Shabet.</p>
          <p>On May 4, 2011, it was announced that Happy Face Entertainment would be merging with Y-WHO Enterprise, small entertainment agency founded by ex-4men member, and current Vibe member, Yoon Min-soo.

          <p>In mid-2012, it was revealed that Bebe Mignon members Haegeum and Park Ga-Eul had left Happy Face Entertainment, effectively disbanding the group. Member Ben has since been re-debuted by the agency as a solo artist.</p>
